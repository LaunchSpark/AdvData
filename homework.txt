Homework #1 - Time Series (working notes)

Assignment tasks
1) The Impact of September 11 on Air Travel in the U.S.
   - Plot each of the three monthly series from Sept11Travel.xls: Air, Rail, Car.
   - Describe what type of trends appear.
   - Change the scale and add trendlines, then describe any new trend insight.

2) Forecasting Department Store Sales
   - Create a well-formatted time plot from DepartmentStoreSales.csv.
   - Explain which components appear to be present: trend, seasonality, noise.

Analysis so far (carried over)
- It seems that car and airline travel are moving upward while trains are on their way out already.
- There also seems to be a slight change around 9/11 that should be inspected more carefully in a zoomed view and in standardized-scale plots.

Markdown analysis placeholders are intentionally left in the notebook so final written interpretations can be added after running the plots.
